# Dataquest Guided Project: Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis.
So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*
